## ACID

ACID is a feature of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity.

- Atomicity: Transaction is a single unit
- Consistency: Data wont get corrupt by your transaction
- Isolation: Concurrent transactions do not influence each other
  - here it gets more complicated as conflicts are possible and strategies exist (concurrency control mechanisms) to
    mitigate them
- Durability: Survive power outage
